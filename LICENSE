This repository contains a variety of cores and examples and they are
licensed under a wide variete of licenses :

 - MIT license
 - BSD 3-clause license
 - GNU General Public License v3
 - GNU Lesser General Public License v3
 - CERN OpenHardware License (one of the 3 variants)

 Full license text for those is available in the doc/ directory.

Each file/project/core has the applicable license in its header.

This repository also contains submodules that are licensed under their
own licenses.

In general I target the CERN-OHL for the HDL and MIT or GPL/LGPL for the
software. It's however possible some have not been migrated yet. If you
want some of the code here under a different license, feel free to ask.
